              <summary>Will you really manage one duplex?</summary>
              <p>Yes. One to twenty units is the entire business. A single-unit owner gets the same statement, portal, and maintenance line as the twenty-unit accounts.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Can I keep using my own plumber and HVAC guy?</summary>
              <p>Yes, as long as they're licensed, insured, and answer the phone. Put them on your vendor list during onboarding and we'll dispatch them first.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Who holds the security deposits?</summary>
              <p>Deposits sit in a separate trust account, never in operating funds. At move-out the tenant gets an itemized statement of any withholding inside the window Wisconsin law requires, and you get a copy.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>What happens if a tenant stops paying?</summary>
              <p>Notice goes out on the schedule your lease and state law allow, we document everything, and we coordinate with your attorney if it reaches a filing. You approve the decision to proceed; we handle the legwork and appear in court.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>How do I get out of the agreement?</summary>
              <p>Thirty days' written notice after the first twelve months, no penalty. Leases, deposits, ledgers, and tenant contacts go out in a format the next manager can load.</p>
