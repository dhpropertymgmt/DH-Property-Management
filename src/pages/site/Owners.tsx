          <details>
            <summary>Do I need to carry different insurance?</summary>
            <p>You'll need a landlord policy with liability, and we ask to be named as an additional interest so we get notice if it lapses. We also require tenants to carry renters insurance and we verify it at move-in.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Who signs the lease &mdash; you or me?</summary>
            <p>We sign as your agent, with your entity named as owner. You see every executed lease in the portal the day it's signed.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I still use the unit for family, or sell mid-lease?</summary>
            <p>Yes to both. A sale doesn't break the lease; the buyer takes the property subject to it. Give us notice and we'll coordinate showings around tenant rights and hand the file to the buyer's manager.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What if I want to approve every tenant myself?</summary>
            <p>Some owners do. We'll send you the screening file with our recommendation and you make the call. Screening criteria stay fixed and applied to everyone equally &mdash; that part isn't negotiable, for fair-housing reasons.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Do you manage properties you or your partners own?</summary>
            <p>Yes, and we'll tell you which ones. Our units never get priority on showings, dispatch, or listing spend, and we'll put that in the agreement.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What does a turnover usually run?</summary>
            <p>Paint, clean, carpet, and small repairs on a two-bedroom in this market typically lands in the high hundreds to low thousands, depending on how the last tenant left it. You get the bid before anything starts.</p>
