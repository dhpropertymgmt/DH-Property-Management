          <h2>Tenant questions</h2>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I get a roommate added to the lease?</summary>
            <p>Yes, if they apply and meet the same standards, and the owner approves. Nobody moves in first and applies after &mdash; that's a lease violation and it puts your tenancy at risk.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I break my lease early?</summary>
            <p>Talk to us before you go. Depending on the lease and the market you may owe rent until the unit is re-rented, plus a re-rental cost. We market the unit immediately, which usually makes it far cheaper than walking away silently.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I paint, mount a TV, or put in a garden?</summary>
            <p>Ask first and we'll ask the owner. Most say yes to paint with a return-to-original condition, and to a TV mount if the holes get patched. Written approval protects both of us at move-out.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Who shovels and mows?</summary>
            <p>It depends on the building and it's stated in your lease. In single-family and most duplexes it's the tenant; in larger buildings we contract it. Sidewalk clearing deadlines are set by your municipality and the fine follows whoever is responsible.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Do I need renters insurance?</summary>
            <p>Yes, and we verify it at move-in. The owner's policy covers the building, not your belongings, and not your liability if something you did floods the unit below.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>My rent is going up. Can we talk about it?</summary>
            <p>You'll get renewal terms well before your lease ends, with the local comparables that produced the number. If the number doesn't work for you, tell us &mdash; a good tenant staying put is worth more than a higher rent with a vacancy in between.</p>
